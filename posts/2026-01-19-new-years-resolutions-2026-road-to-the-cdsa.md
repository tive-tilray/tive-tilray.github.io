# New Year’s Resolutions 2026 - Road to the CDSA

I hope I won’t come off as too direct, but I need this post to be specific. So, let’s go!

## Main goal for 2026

In 2026, my main goal is the **CDSA certification** by **Hack The Box**. That means I will need to complete the **SOC Analyst** path in the Academy.

Getting a job in this field is not my main plan (though I’m not closing myself off to the possibility). This is a hobby driven choice: I want a certification that has a solid structure and ends with a real skills check. For me it needs to be “supervised” and verifiable, not just “I finished a course and done” :)

## Where this direction comes from

In June 2025 I completed the **Cyber Security for Students** path on **Let’sDefend**, and since then I knew I wanted to try blue teaming.

I noticed that what fits me best is working through large amounts of material (for example logs), catching small nuances, understanding context, and connecting the dots. I really enjoyed the **Dynamic Malware Analysis** module, and in practice I also got hooked on spotting **IOCs** in alerts.

## Why CDSA and Hack The Box

Nothing would be happening without **NotTheHiddenWiki** :) This place gave me a huge push to grow. This community gave me a huge push to grow. NTHW and Hack The Box just go hand in hand for me, and I genuinely feel at home in this environment :) Being around people who are already a bit further makes it easier to stay on track, come back to the topic, and not quit after the first tougher moment.

Also... this certificate looks cool, and I’m already waiting for the day I can hang it on my wall :D

*On NotTheHiddenWiki you’ll find a repository with cybersecurity materials. There’s also a Discord open to anyone who wants to dive deeper into cybersecurity.*

## Timeline and approach

To be honest, I don’t feel ready for this certification at all. But I like testing my limits, so why not :)

I’m also aware of reality: I work 12 hour days in a different job, and the SOC Analyst path is big. That’s why:

- **Safe deadline: mid December 2026**  
  I want it to be my gift to myself, especially since I bought the yearly HTB access (Silver Annual) around the holidays.

- **Short term goal: at least 30 hours of learning per month**  
  This is my “minimum threshold” that should work even when life gets intense. But this is mainly a recon goal. How will it go? We’ll see :)

- **Stretch goal: attempt CDSA by June 2026**  
  That would be symbolic, because in June 2025 I finished my previous path. I don’t know yet if it’s realistic, but we’ll keep updating along the way.

The most important thing will be consistency. What changes along the road, we’ll see. June is ambitious, so if it collapses, it’s fine. December is the real line, because even though it’s far away, I treat it as “the end.” And yeah... besides carrots, sometimes you also need a stick :)

## Additional goals (intentionally small)

I also want to add a very short list of “side quests,” so I don’t inflate the plan:

- Record at least 1 video showing my learning process.
- Create at least 1 write up.

Why only that much? Because my brain often works like this: I need a stimulus to start, and then I either don’t stop... or the whole concept goes to the trash :) Depends on what clicks for me. That’s why I test with small steps: I do one thing, and I see if it actually makes sense for me.

## What this blog will be about

I want to run two main tracks here:

1. **Progress**  
   What I did, what I learned, my takeaways, mini write ups from tasks. And from time to time: Sherlock write ups.

2. **Process**  
   The less “pretty” part: how I arrive at things, what I don’t know, where I’m wrong, how I fix my thinking. I want to show learning as it really is, sometimes like watching a small child learn to walk and discover the world from scratch.

I’m doing this publicly for two reasons:
- to get comfortable with the fact that mistakes and failures are not something to be ashamed of
- to show others that you don’t have to be a genius to learn, and that there is no magic “5 ways to learn fast” that makes everything easy (for everyone except us)

This is not meant to be a highlight reel. This is meant to be an honest record of the road.
