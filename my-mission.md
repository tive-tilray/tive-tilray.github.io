# My Mission

This site is my public learning space.

I am documenting two things side by side:

## 1. Progress

Practical work as I move through defensive security:

- HTB CDSA learning notes and progress updates
- small write ups of labs and tasks (high level, no spoilers)
- occasional Sherlock write ups and investigation notes

## 2. Process

The part that is usually hidden:

- how I think through problems
- what I assume, what I miss, and what I learn
- the moments where I am stuck, and how I get unstuck

I want this to feel like watching someone learn in real time, including the awkward steps.

## Why do this publicly

Because I want to normalize the truth:

- mistakes are not embarrassing, they are data
- confusion is part of learning, not a sign you do not belong
- there is no single "fast method" that replaces effort and repetition

Social media often looks like everyone else has a perfect plan and instant results.
This is my counter example: honest learning, in the open.

## What you can expect here

- clear notes over polished storytelling
- more questions than conclusions
- gradual improvement, with visible rough edges

If something is wrong, it stays visible long enough to be corrected.
That is the point.
